<h2>Lifetime Plans</h2>
<p>
A Ig Repost lifetime plan allows you to access Ig Repost premium features available at the time or your purchase for as long as those services are available. You may not assign lifetime plans to any other person. We make no warranties or representations as to the expected lifetime of the Ig Repost services, and in purchasing a lifetime plan, you acknowledge and agree that the Ig Repost services could change or terminate in the future.<br/>
<br/>
</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>
Your payment is managed by Apple via iTunes and you will need to contact Apple customer service for refunds, as we are not able to process refunds ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
</p>

<h2>Pricing changes</h2>
<p>
We may change the pricing plan at our discretion. In this case we will try to inform you before any changes so you can modify or cancel your subscription before the changes are made. We accept no responsibility for any losses you may incur by failing to change your subscription after we have informed you of any changes to the pricing plan.<br/>
